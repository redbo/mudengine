This is a copy of [tscreen.go](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/blob/d650ce5ff5b069f119b185943c2cb190dca151fe/tscreen.go) from the [tcell repo](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell), modified to work without environment variables or signals or an actual tty, so you can hopefully have a bunch of them in one process.
